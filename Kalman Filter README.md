# Stock Price Analysis with Kalman Filter Signal

This Python code utilizes the Kalman filter to generate a trading signal based on stock price data. It fetches historical price data for the ^GDAXI index from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library. The Kalman filter is then applied to estimate the underlying trend of the stock price, and a trading signal is generated based on the relationship between the stock price and the estimated trend.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- `yfinance` for retrieving historical price data from Yahoo Finance.
- `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `plotly.subplots` and `plotly.graph_objects` for creating interactive plots.
- `pykalman` for implementing the Kalman filter.

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries at the beginning of your script.
2. Modify the `start` and `end` dates in the `yf.download()` function to specify the desired time range for the price data.
3. Define the state space model parameters for the Kalman filter:
   - `observation_matrices`: observation matrix of the state space model.
   - `transition_matrices`: transition matrix of the state space model.
   - `observation_covariance`: covariance matrix of the observation noise.
   - `transition_covariance`: covariance matrix of the transition noise.
   - `initial_state_mean`: initial mean of the state variables.
   - `initial_state_covariance`: initial covariance of the state variables.
4. Initialize the Kalman filter by creating an instance of the `KalmanFilter` class with the specified parameters.
5. Run the Kalman filter on the stock price data using the `filter()` method, which returns the estimated state means and covariances.
6. Generate trading signals based on the estimated state variables. In this code, a signal of 1 is assigned when the stock price is above the estimated trend, and a signal of -1 is assigned when the stock price is below the trend.
7. Create subplots using `make_subplots()` to display the stock price, estimated trend, and trading signal.
8. Add traces to the subplots using `go.Scatter()` for each data series.
9. Customize the plot layout, including titles and axis labels, using the `update_layout()` method.
10. Display the plot using `fig.show()`.

Feel free to modify the code to analyze different stock indices or adjust the Kalman filter parameters to suit your needs.
